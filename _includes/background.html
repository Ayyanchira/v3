      As a software engineer, I enjoy participating in each phase of software development life cycle starting from creating stories, creating prototypes and wireframes (Yes I love doing it too like <a class="underline-link" href ="https://www.figma.com/file/LNPXr52vQcjTL70MMcHkZ4uh/UNCC-YesPlusAppIdea?node-id=0%3A1" target="_blank">this one</a>), discussing and designing the right architecture and coding (of course) with high focus on keeping the code modular and reusable following the right design patterns which the architecture requires. I have used MVC and MVVM patterns and currently learning how protocol oriented programming works.
